Q1. In the vacuum cleaner domain in part 1, what were the states and actions? What is the branching factor?

A1. Actions: {GO_<direction>, SUCK_DIRT}
    States: ########
    Branching factor: ##########

Q2. What is the difference between Breadth First Search and Uniform Cost Search in a domain where the cost
    of each action is 1?

A2. The implementation (FIFO queue vs priority queue). They behave in the same way though when the cost
    is constant (e.g. the domain given in the question).

Q3. Suppose that h1 and h2 are admissible heuristics (used in for example A*). Which of the following are
    also admissible?
    a) (h1+h2)/2
    b) 2h1
    c) max (h1,h2)

A3. (a) and (c)

Q4. If one would use A* to search for a path to one specific square in the vacuum domain, what could the
    heuristic (h) be? The cost function (g)? Is it an admissible heuristic?

A4. h: ⌊√(|Δx * Δy|)⌋ where Δ{x,y} is the distance from current position to target in the axis. (i.e.
    manhattan distance)
    g: #######
    Admissable.
    
Q5. Draw and explain. Choose your three favorite search algorithms and apply them to any problem domain
    it might be a good idea to use a domain where you can identify a good heuristic function). Draw the
    search tree for them, and explain how they proceed in the searching. Also include the memory usage.
    You can attach a hand-made drawing.

A5. #########


Q6. Look at all the offline search algorithms presented in chapter 3 plus A* search. Are they complete?
    Are they optimal? Explain why!

    Breadth-First - complete, optimal
    Uniform-Cost - complete, optimal
    Depth-First - neither
    Depth-Limited - neither
    Iterative-Deepening - complete, optimal
    Bidirectional - complete, optimal
    A* - complete, optimal

Q7. Assume that you had to go back and do Lab 1/Task 2 once more (if you did not use search already).
    Remember that the agent did not have perfect knowledge of the environment but had to explore it
    incrementally. Which of the search algorithms you have learned would be most suited in this situation
    to guide the agent's execution? What would you search for? Give an example.
