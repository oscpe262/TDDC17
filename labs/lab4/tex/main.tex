\section{Task 2}
\begin{framed}\em You should hand in a written description of your experimental setup (the problem parameters you chose, how you varied them etc.) and the results of the experiment, in the form of tables and/or graphs.

If you're able, try to explain why changes in different problem parameters have (or don't have) different effects on different planners.\em\end{framed}
