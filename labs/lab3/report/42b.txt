We assume the person has no sudden unforeseen medical or mental changes. Mr.HS could for example have a stroke and be unable to react to the warning lights, despight never having had a stroke before. We also assume he doesn't get better at doing his job. A few years of experience should unavoidably add to his ability to react correctly to the warning lights. In our model it does not. In the previous question we assume that he knows how to drive, and drive well enough under stress. All and all the people in the bayesian network covered in these labs are heavily simplified.
